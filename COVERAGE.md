## IP IS CANONIC

| Artifact | Closure Type | What It Documents |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **COVERAGE** | **Internal** | What we built. What we claim. What's inside. |
| **ROADMAP** | **External** | What existed before. Dependencies. What's outside. |

```
IP = CANON + COVERAGE + ROADMAP + LEDGER
```

**Every axiom in CANON is an atomic IDF.**

| Axiom | IDF Title | Prior Art |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 1. Triad | Governance Triad Requirement | No direct prior art |
| 2. Inheritance | Axiom Inheritance Chain | OOP inheritance (adapted) |
| 3. Introspection | Vocabulary Closure | Formal grammars (adapted) |

**Novel contributions:** Triad as governance primitive. Constitutional governance = IP protection.

## 1. External Survey

| Standard | Specification | Authority |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| RFC 2119 | Key words for requirement levels | IETF |
| CommonMark | Markdown specification | commonmark.org |
| Git | Distributed version control | git-scm.com |

## 2. RFC 2119 Comparison

**Source:** https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119

| Feature | RFC 2119 | CANONIC | Gap | Status |
|---------|----------|---------|-----|--------|
| MUST keyword | Yes | Yes | — | Closed |
| SHOULD keyword | Yes | Yes | — | Closed |
| MAY keyword | Yes | Yes | — | Closed |
| Requirement semantics | Yes | Yes | — | Closed |

## 3. The Fundamental Difference

| Feature | RFC 2119 | CANONIC |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Governance axioms | No | **Yes** |
| Inheritance chain | No | **Yes** |
| Vocabulary closure | No | **Yes** |
| Validity predicate | No | **Yes** |

RFC 2119 defines keywords. CANONIC defines a complete governance system.

## 6. Open/Closed Analysis (Discovery 2026-01-22)

**Strategic boundary between open and closed components.**

### What's OPEN (Internal Closure = Public Claims)

| Component | Status | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| CANON.md axioms | OPEN | Governance requires transparency |
| VOCAB.md terms | OPEN | Semantic precision requires scrutiny |
| LANGUAGE spec | OPEN | 79% of orgs require code inspection |
| Validators (source) | OPEN | "Many eyes" builds trust |
| COVERAGE.md | OPEN | Claims must be verifiable |
| ROADMAP.md | OPEN | Dependencies must be auditable |

### What's CLOSED (External = Proprietary)

| Component | Status | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| VaaS implementation | CLOSED | Revenue stream, competitive moat |
| APPS (TRANSCRIPT, etc.) | CLOSED | Application layer value-add |
| Certification authority | HYBRID | Open criteria, proprietary badge |
| Black-box validators | CLOSED | Never disclose implementation |

### The IP Boundary

```
OPEN (Claims)              CLOSED (Moat)
├── IP = CANON +           ├── VaaS implementation
│      COVERAGE +          ├── APPS execution
│      ROADMAP +           ├── Certification badge
│      LEDGER              └── Enterprise support
└── Anyone can verify      └── Only Foundation executes
```

### Ethics Considerations

**TBD: Ethics Director review pending.**

Preliminary framework:
- Transparency in governance (open axioms)
- Accountability in execution (closed but auditable)
- Community voice in evolution
- No monopolization of truth

*Section to be completed with Ethics Director input.*

## 7. Conclusion

CANONIC root internal closure is **complete**.

All axioms are defined, all concepts are documented, all artifacts are present.

**Open/Closed boundary defined:** Open core (governance), closed execution (revenue).
