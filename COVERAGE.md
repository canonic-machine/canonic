# COVERAGE (/)

**Purpose:** Track CANONIC root governance coverage against external standards.

**Data Source:** https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119

## 1. External Survey

| Standard | Specification | Authority |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| RFC 2119 | Key words for requirement levels | IETF |
| CommonMark | Markdown specification | commonmark.org |
| Git | Distributed version control | git-scm.com |

## 2. RFC 2119 Comparison

**Source:** https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119

| Feature | RFC 2119 | CANONIC | Gap | Status |
|---------|----------|---------|-----|--------|
| MUST keyword | Yes | Yes | — | Closed |
| SHOULD keyword | Yes | Yes | — | Closed |
| MAY keyword | Yes | Yes | — | Closed |
| Requirement semantics | Yes | Yes | — | Closed |

## 3. The Fundamental Difference

| Feature | RFC 2119 | CANONIC |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Governance axioms | No | **Yes** |
| Inheritance chain | No | **Yes** |
| Vocabulary closure | No | **Yes** |
| Validity predicate | No | **Yes** |

RFC 2119 defines keywords. CANONIC defines a complete governance system.
