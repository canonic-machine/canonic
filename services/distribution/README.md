# DISTRIBUTION

Distribution services for validated artifacts.

## Children

- `/publishing/` — Human-targeted distribution
- `/appstore/` — Machine-targeted distribution (closes SERVICES)

## Shared Axioms

All distribution inherits:
1. Dissemination-only
2. Freeze-anchored

## The Closure

APPSTORE closes the SERVICES loop:
```
PRODUCTS → DISTRIBUTION → APPSTORE → External consumers
```
