# PRODUCTS

Product services for intellectual artifacts.

## Children

- `/paper/` — Academic papers (epistemic-only)
- `/books/` — Long-form creative works (private)
- `/grants/` — Research funding proposals (private until funded)

## Shared Axioms

All products inherit:
1. Evidence-based
2. Freeze-bounded
3. Reproducible

## Inheritance

```
