## The Problem You Named

At UCF AI in Medicine Summit 2024, you asked:

> "How often does medical knowledge double? **Every 35 days.** Is there any hope for doctors keeping up without AI?"

**If medical knowledge doubles every 35 days, we need governance that can keep pace.**

---

## Traditional Governance Can't Keep Up

| System | Speed | Problem |
|--------|-------|---------|
| FDA approval | Years | Too slow for AI iteration |
| IRB review | Months | Designed for static protocols |
| Publication | 6-12 months | Knowledge already obsolete |
| Tech transfer | Years | IP disputes while patients wait |

---

## CANONIC: 50 Years of Computer Science in 21 Days

| CANONIC | Speed | How |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Commit | Seconds | Git version control |
| Provenance | Instant | Blockchain verification |
| Governance | Days | Validator consensus |
| Patient payments | Real-time | Token distribution |

**If knowledge doubles every 35 days, governance must move faster than 35 days.**

**CANONIC does.**

## MammoChat: The Proof

- **20,000+ mammograms** from AdventHealth
- **$2M FDOH grant** (public domain per terms)
- **Clinical trials live** (NCT06604078, NCT07214883)
- **Blockchain-ledgered provenance** from 2017 Bloomberg to 2026 release

## AIMed26 Orlando: The Moment

| Month | Event | Milestone |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Oct 2026 | MammoChat Summit | Patients first |
| Nov 2026 | AIMed26 Orlando | Industry showcase |

**AdventHealth as Lead CANONIC Sponsor. You as steward.**

---

## The Ask

1. **Keynote slot** — "From Bloomberg 2017 to CANONIC 2026"
2. **Governance track** — Open source AI accountability
3. **Sponsor tier** — Lead CANONIC Sponsor (AdventHealth ready)

**AIMed becomes the conference that doesn't just talk about responsible AI — it demonstrates it.**

---

**AIMed is the stage. You are the steward.**
