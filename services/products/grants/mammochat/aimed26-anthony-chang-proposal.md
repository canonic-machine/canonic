# AIMed 2026 Orlando - CANONIC Partnership Proposal

**Date:** January 19, 2026
**To:** Dr. Anthony Chang, Founder, AIMed
**From:** Dr. Dexter Hadley
**Re:** AIMed 2026 Orlando - CANONIC Governance Showcase

---

## Executive Summary

**AIMed becomes the platform for open source AI governance in healthcare.**

Anthony, you headlined UCF AI in Medicine Summit in 2024. You asked the audience: "How often does medical knowledge double? It doubles every 35 days. Is there any hope for doctors keeping up without AI?"

**If medical knowledge doubles every 35 days, we need governance that can keep pace.**

CANONIC compressed 50 years of computer science history into 21 days:
- Git (version control)
- Blockchain (provenance)
- Token economics (patient payments)
- Open source licensing (public domain)

**CANONIC is the governance layer that makes responsible AI real — not just a conference discussion.**

AIMed26 Orlando is the moment:
- MammoChat public release (first open source AI breast cancer platform)
- CANONIC governance showcase (first blockchain-ledgered AI provenance)
- Patient stakeholder model debut (first to pay patients for their data)
- AdventHealth as Lead CANONIC Sponsor (first major health system to lead)

**This is the next evolution of AIMed's mission.**

## Why CANONIC Matters for AIMed

### The Problem You've Been Solving

AIMed conferences bring together the AI in medicine community to discuss:
- Responsible AI development
- Ethical considerations
- Clinical validation
- Regulatory pathways

**But discussion isn't governance.**

Hospitals sponsor. Vendors exhibit. Papers are presented. Everyone goes home.

Where's the accountability? Where's the provenance? Where's the patient voice?

### CANONIC Is the Answer

| AIMed Discussion | CANONIC Governance |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "AI should be transparent" | Blockchain-ledgered provenance |
| "Patients should benefit" | Data dividends, token economics |
| "Open source is better" | Public domain per grant terms |
| "We need accountability" | Git-based evidence chain |

**CANONIC turns AIMed's principles into infrastructure.**

### The Speed Problem

You said medical knowledge doubles every 35 days. Traditional governance can't keep up:

| System | Speed | Problem |
|--------|-------|---------|
| FDA approval | Years | Too slow for AI iteration |
| IRB review | Months | Designed for static protocols |
| Publication | 6-12 months | Knowledge already obsolete |
| Tech transfer | Years | IP disputes while patients wait |

**CANONIC operates at git speed:**

| CANONIC | Speed | Advantage |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Commit | Seconds | Every change ledgered |
| Provenance | Instant | Blockchain verification |
| Governance | Days | Validator consensus |
| Patient payments | Real-time | Token distribution |

**50 years of computer science compressed into 21 days of development.**

If knowledge doubles every 35 days, governance must move faster than 35 days. CANONIC does.

### Why This Matters for AIMed

**No IP claims exist on MammoChat:**
1. Foundation built at UCSF with NIH funding = federal/public
2. Dr. Hadley separated from UCF 2 weeks before award = no employment IP
3. FDOH grant requires public domain = no UCF IP
4. Clinical trials under public domain terms = open source

**This is the cleanest AI provenance story in healthcare.**

AIMed26 can showcase the first fully-documented, blockchain-ledgered, open source AI platform with complete provenance from conception to clinical trial.

## The AdventHealth Connection

Rob Purinton (Chief AI Officer) is ready to be Lead CANONIC Sponsor.

**Why Rob is in:**
- AdventHealth contributed 20K+ patient mammograms
- UCF built the model but can't commercialize (grant terms)
- AdventHealth can't commercialize either (not-for-profit)
- CANONIC governance lets both serve patients without IP disputes
- Patients get paid for their data contributions

**What Rob gets:**
- Governance seat — shape open source AI policy
- Industry recognition — "AdventHealth led this"
- Cost savings — $1.5M+ vs. proprietary alternatives
- Mission alignment — not-for-profit to not-for-profit

---

## The Pattern

| Month | Event | Milestone |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Oct 2026** | MammoChat Summit | Patient-focused launch, WholeLife Church |
| **Nov 2026** | AIMed26 Orlando | Industry showcase, CANONIC governance debut |

MammoChat Summit (patients) → AIMed26 (industry)

**Same story. Two audiences. Complete ecosystem.**

---

## What I'm Asking

**AIMed26 Orlando becomes the CANONIC governance showcase.**

1. **Keynote slot** for the MammoChat/CANONIC story
2. **Technical track** for CANONIC architecture
3. **Governance track** for open source AI accountability
4. **Sponsor tier** for Lead CANONIC Sponsor (AdventHealth)
5. **Patient voice** integration (WholeLife Church representatives)

**In return:**
- AIMed becomes synonymous with responsible AI governance
- First conference to showcase blockchain-ledgered AI provenance
- Industry leadership in the open source healthcare AI movement
- The story that every other conference will reference

---

## Why Orlando

| Factor | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| AIMed24 was in Orlando | Coming home |
| AdventHealth HQ | Lead sponsor's home market |
| UCF College of Medicine | Grant recipient location |
| WholeLife Church | Community partner venue |
| Dr. Hadley | Based in Florida |

**Everything converges in Orlando.**

## The Ask

Anthony, you keynoted UCF AIMS in 2024. You've built AIMed as the platform for AI in medicine.

At UCF AIMS you said: "Any single pathologist looking at melanoma sees maybe 100,000 examples. AI can see hundreds of millions."

**MammoChat is that AI.** 20,000+ mammograms from AdventHealth. Open source. Public domain. Blockchain-ledgered provenance.

**CANONIC is the governance** that ensures it stays accountable.

You gave the keynote at UCF AIMS. Now headline AIMed26 Orlando with the working system you described.

Let's make AIMed26 the moment when responsible AI in healthcare stops being a conference discussion and becomes infrastructure.

**AIMed is the stage. You are the steward.**
