# AIMed 2026 Orlando - CANONIC Sponsorship Proposal

**Date:** January 19, 2026
**To:** AdventHealth Leadership
**From:** Dr. Dexter Hadley, Chief of Artificial Intelligence, UCF
**Re:** AIMed 2026 Orlando - Lead CANONIC Sponsor

---

## Executive Summary

**AdventHealth leads open source AI in healthcare.**

This proposal positions AdventHealth as the **first Lead CANONIC Sponsor** — the healthcare organization that proves patients can be stakeholders, not just data sources.

Rob Purinton, Chief AI Officer, becomes the executive who:
- Led the first open source AI governance initiative in healthcare
- Demonstrated that not-for-profits can pay patients for their data
- Showed that mission-aligned partnerships outperform proprietary solutions
- Made AdventHealth the model for responsible AI in medicine

**This is impact. This is leadership. This is AdventHealth first.**

---

### Buying AIMed Sponsorship Isn't Enough

| Sponsorship Type | What You Get | Impact |
|------------------|--------------|--------|
| Presenting Partner | Logo, booth, breakout session | **Brand visibility** |
| **Lead CANONIC Sponsor** | Governance seat, patient payments, open source leadership | **Industry transformation** |

AdventHealth has been Presenting Partner at AIMed24 and AIMed25. Logo on the wall. Breakout sessions. Brand visibility.

**That's table stakes. That's not leadership.**

Lead CANONIC Sponsor means:
- **Governance seat**: Shape the rules for AI in healthcare
- **Patient payments**: First to pay patients for their data contributions
- **Open source leadership**: Model for responsible AI that others follow
- **MammoChat showcase**: Platform built from AdventHealth's 20K patients goes public
- **Industry recognition**: "AdventHealth led this" — not just "AdventHealth sponsored this"

Rob doesn't want another logo on a conference banner. Rob wants to **lead something that matters.**

**CANONIC is that something.**

## The Numbers

### Cost Savings: Open Source vs. Proprietary

| Approach | 5-Year Cost | Risk |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Proprietary AI vendor | $2-5M+ | Vendor lock-in, black box, no governance |
| UCF-only development | $1.5M+ | IP disputes, politics, slow iteration |
| **CANONIC Open Source** | **$250K sponsor + existing grants** | **Public domain, transparent, community-driven** |

**AdventHealth saves $1.5M+ over 5 years** by leading open source governance instead of building or buying proprietary.

### Contract Value Already Secured

| Source | Amount | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| FDOH FCIF Grant 354 | $1,998,935 | Awarded (UCF prime) |
| AdventHealth Subaward | $69,000 | Executed |
| **Lead CANONIC Sponsor** | **$250,000** | **This proposal** |

**Total ecosystem investment: $2.3M+** — AdventHealth gets governance leadership for 11% of total investment.

### ROI for AdventHealth

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Brand leadership | First Lead CANONIC Sponsor in AI healthcare |
| Governance seat | Shape open source AI policy for healthcare |
| Cost avoidance | $1.5M+ vs. proprietary alternatives |
| Community goodwill | WholeLife Church + patient focus groups |
| Research partnership | UCF + CANONIC Foundation |

**$250K investment → $1.5M+ cost avoidance = 6x ROI**

### Key Insight for Rob

**No IP claims exist on MammoChat because:**

1. **2017**: Foundation built at UCSF with federal (NIH) funding = public
2. **2024**: Dr. Hadley separated from UCF 2 weeks before award = no employment IP
3. **2024**: FDOH grant requires public domain = no UCF IP
4. **2025**: Clinical trials under public domain terms = open source

**Rob's opportunity**: Lead governance of something nobody can own. First mover advantage in open source AI healthcare governance.

---

### The 20,000 Patient Advantage

**AdventHealth contributed 20,000+ patient mammograms to MammoChat.**

| Entity | Status | Constraint |
|--------|--------|------------|
| UCF | Public university | Bound by FDOH public domain grant terms |
| AdventHealth | **Not-for-profit** | Cannot commercialize, mission-driven |
| Canonic Foundation | **Not-for-profit** | Governance + open source infrastructure |

**UCF built a model from AdventHealth images. Neither can commercialize.**

- UCF: Grant requires public domain
- AdventHealth: Not-for-profit status

**But CANONIC governance enables something better than commercialization:**

Under CANONIC:
- Open source infrastructure = public domain (per grant) ✓
- Not-for-profit governance = mission-aligned ✓
- Patient relationships = AdventHealth's ministry ✓
- 20,000 mammograms = community contribution, community benefit ✓
- Value flows to patients, not shareholders

**Rob's position**: AdventHealth serves patients. UCF serves research. CANONIC serves both — and pays the patients.

---

### Pay the Patients

| Entity | Can Pay Patients? | Why |
|--------|-------------------|-----|
| UCF | **NO** | Grant terms, institutional bureaucracy, IRB constraints |
| AdventHealth | **YES** | Not-for-profit ministry, direct patient relationships |
| Canonic Foundation | **YES** | Not-for-profit governance, token economics, data dividends |

**Two not-for-profits aligned on patient benefit:**
- AdventHealth: Ministry + patient care
- Canonic Foundation: Governance + patient payments

**20,000 patients contributed their mammograms. Under CANONIC governance, they get paid.**

- **Data dividends**: Patients share in commercial value of their contributions
- **Token economics**: CANONIC coin rewards data contributors
- **Community ownership**: Patients are stakeholders, not just subjects
- **WholeLife Church**: Community distribution channel for patient rewards

**This is the AdventHealth mission in action**: Patients aren't data sources to be extracted — they're partners who share in the value they create.

**UCF cannot do this. Only CANONIC can.**

---

### UCF Did Nothing Wrong

UCF did exactly what the system allows:
- Applied for grant ✓
- Won award ✓
- Built model from partner images ✓
- Published research ✓
- Released to public domain ✓

**UCF is bound by contradictory canon:**

| Mandate | Requirement | Conflict |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Public university | Open, accessible | vs. commercialize |
| FDOH grant terms | Public domain | vs. tech transfer |
| Technology transfer office | Monetize IP | vs. public domain |
| Faculty requirements | Publish research | vs. protect IP |
| Institutional overhead | Extract value | vs. patient benefit |

**UCF cannot resolve these contradictions. The system is the problem.**

**The contradictions flow from Tallahassee down:**
- State legislature mandates public benefit
- Board of Governors demands commercialization
- University tech transfer extracts overhead
- Faculty caught in the middle
- Patients get nothing

**AdventHealth is bound by their legal canon — mission + cost savings:**

| AdventHealth Mandate | CANONIC Delivery |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Not-for-profit mission | Patient-centered governance |
| Fiduciary duty | Cost savings vs. proprietary ($1.5M+) |
| Community benefit | WholeLife Church distribution |
| Ministry extension | Pay the patients |

**Canonic Foundation has no contradiction:**

| | Canonic Foundation |
|--|-------------------|
| Status | Not-for-profit |
| Mission | Patient governance |
| IP mandate | Open source |
| Tech transfer | None |
| Overhead extraction | None |

**UCF does the paperwork. The two not-for-profits do the mission.**

### Cost Savings for AdventHealth Legal

| Alternative | 5-Year Cost | AdventHealth Risk |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Build proprietary AI | $2-5M+ | Full development burden, liability |
| Buy vendor solution | $1-3M+ | Vendor lock-in, no governance |
| UCF partnership only | $1.5M+ | IP disputes, politics, no commercialization |
| **CANONIC governance** | **$250K sponsor** | **Open source, mission-aligned, patients paid** |

**AdventHealth legal sees:**
- $250K investment → $1.5M+ cost avoidance = **6x ROI**
- No IP liability (public domain)
- Mission-aligned (not-for-profit to not-for-profit)
- Community benefit documented (WholeLife Church)
- Patient benefit demonstrated (data dividends)

Traditional academic research:
- Patients donate data for free
- Institutions publish papers
- Commercial value extracted elsewhere
- Patients get nothing

**CANONIC is the fix:**
- Patients contribute data
- Open source infrastructure (grant-compliant)
- Commercial applications (partner-enabled)
- **Patients get paid**

Rob isn't fighting UCF. Rob is **leading the transition** to a system where patients share in the value they create.

**The current system has no governance.** Patients sign consent forms. Data flows to institutions. Value is extracted. Nobody is accountable to the patients.

**CANONIC is governance.** Blockchain-ledgered provenance. Transparent value flows. Patient stakeholders. Accountable to contributors.

---

### This Was the Original Grant Vision

The FDOH FCIF Grant 354 proposal always envisioned:
- Patients as contributors AND stakeholders
- Community-driven breast cancer research
- Open source infrastructure for public benefit
- Value flowing back to patients

**FDOH funded this vision. CANONIC delivers it.**

| Proposed | Funded | Delivered |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Patient stakeholders | ✓ | CANONIC governance |
| Community-driven | ✓ | WholeLife Church + focus groups |
| Open source | ✓ | Public domain per grant |
| Patient benefit | ✓ | Data dividends, token economics |

Dr. Hadley proposed it. FDOH funded it. UCF built it. CANONIC governs it. Rob leads it.

This is why AdventHealth should be first.

**This is why Rob needs CANONIC** — it's the only path to commercialize what UCF built from AdventHealth's patients, AND pay those patients for their contribution.
