3. **Collaboration** - Open infrastructure, protected applications

| MammoChat Showcase | Debut of AI breast cancer platform |
| Open Source Recognition | Leadership in responsible AI governance |
| Research Collaboration | Continued UCF partnership |

### Sponsorship Tiers

---

## The Numbers

### Cost Savings: Open Source vs. Proprietary

| Approach | 5-Year Cost | Risk |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Proprietary AI vendor | $2-5M+ | Vendor lock-in, black box, no governance |
| UCF-only development | $1.5M+ | IP disputes, politics, slow iteration |
| **CANONIC Open Source** | **$250K sponsor + existing grants** | **Public domain, transparent, community-driven** |

**AdventHealth saves $1.5M+ over 5 years** by leading open source governance instead of building or buying proprietary.

### Contract Value Already Secured

| Source | Amount | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| FDOH FCIF Grant 354 | $1,998,935 | Awarded (UCF prime) |
| AdventHealth Subaward | $69,000 | Executed |
| **Lead CANONIC Sponsor** | **$250,000** | **This proposal** |

**Total ecosystem investment: $2.3M+** — AdventHealth gets governance leadership for 11% of total investment.

### ROI for AdventHealth

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Brand leadership | First Lead CANONIC Sponsor in AI healthcare |
| Governance seat | Shape open source AI policy for healthcare |
| Cost avoidance | $1.5M+ vs. proprietary alternatives |
| Community goodwill | WholeLife Church + patient focus groups |
| Research partnership | UCF + CANONIC Foundation |

**$250K investment → $1.5M+ cost avoidance = 6x ROI**

### Key Insight for Rob

**No IP claims exist on MammoChat because:**

1. **2017**: Foundation built at UCSF with federal (NIH) funding = public
2. **2024**: Dr. Hadley separated from UCF 2 weeks before award = no employment IP
3. **2024**: FDOH grant requires public domain = no UCF IP
4. **2025**: Clinical trials under public domain terms = open source

**Rob's opportunity**: Lead governance of something nobody can own. First mover advantage in open source AI healthcare governance.
