7. Project/Study Information- Research Type
All applications submitted in response to this funding opportunity must be responsive to one of the most prevalent cancer diagnoses in Florida or cancers impacting pediatrics. This funding opportunity encourages different research
types including those listed below:
1. Translational Research: Projects designed to translate scientific bench discoveries to practical therapeutic interventions in a clinical setting. These efforts can relate to studies intended for translation to human subjects (Phase I
clinical trials), translation to patients (Phase II, III clinical trials), translation to practice (Phase IV clinical trials), and/or translation to population health.
2. Implementation Research: Research projects focused on methodologies designed to promote the implementation of verified clinical treatments and practices into routine healthcare protocols at a clinical and organizational level.
These studies can also focus on the de-implementation of clinical practices deemed to be of low or insignificant benefit to patient care and outcomes.
3. Open Science: Increases rigor and transparency of research studies while maximizing return on research investments. Open Science establishes repositories for sharing research as research is being conducted. This includes open
access by sharing of information and making progress and findings accessible while the research is being conducted. This accelerates the sharing of knowledge while the research is being conducted and project aims and progress
toward aims is shared. Knowledge is shared throughout the project period with all grantees. More people can become more involved and collaborate with multiple institutions. Scientist self-correcting reduces gaps and reduces
problems and short-timeframe deadlines.
4. Patient and Family Support: Research that focuses on psychosocial support for patients and families, including patients participating in their care to improve outcomes. This research also includes supporting and encouraging
patient engagement in improving the quality of care provided by their care team for the continuity of care. Examples can include access to support groups provided by the healthcare organizations or partners and patient navigators.
5. Treatment-Related Morbidities: Expand upon research that improves scientific understanding of causes and subsequent impact of cancer/cancer-treatment related morbidities in other systems (e.g., cardiovascular, pulmonary,
endocrine, lymphatic, central nervous system, reproductive, and developmental).
6. Technology Transfer Feasibility (TTF): The goals of the TTF grant mechanism are to stimulate technology transfer activities for promising research discoveries that could lead to innovations in the prevention, diagnosis,
treatment, and/or cure of cancer and strengthen a project’s economic feasibility and commercialization prospects. The primary objective is to assist investigators in moving promising research findings toward commercialization. The
TTF grant offers early-stage funding to develop intellectual property and improve its commercial potential and competitiveness for further development activities, including company formation or partnering with private interests.
Projects should be designed to establish the technical/scientific merit and feasibility needed to attract commercial interest.
7. Treatment Studies: Proposals should explore innovative treatment models, including the latest research trends and emerging therapies. These studies should highlight promising treatments that have the potential to drive further
research and development in the field.
8. Special populations: Research targeting specific or niche groups, including pediatric populations.
This funding opportunity encourages different research types including those listed below: *

FIELD OF STUDY

A. Personal Statement
My research focus has long been geared towards translational medicine. I have made significant translational discoveries
across the neuropsychiatric disease spectrum at the Center for Applied Genomics in The Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia, which houses the largest academic pediatric biobank in the world. My work has resulted in an ongoing
‘precision medicine’ clinical trial for ADHD (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02286817) for a first-in-class, non-stimulant
neuromodulator, and I co-founded a company, neuroFix Therapeutics, that was recently successfully acquired based on
early positive trial results. At Stanford, I moved towards developing tools and databases to organize public data stores by
crowd-sourcing the annotation of over 1.6 million samples within NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for
downstream analysis. As a PI at UCSF, my laboratory integrated analysis of this datastore with many different functional
databases and advances in digital health to better characterize signature patterns of disease and identify novel
interventions to optimize disease management. Moving forward as a new PI at UCF jointly supported by HCA Healthcare,
my laboratory will continue to build data driven interventions in healthcare that can be developed, tested, and eventually
deployed at scale to improve the health and well-being of large populations of patients in a clinical setting.

My expertise in leveraging multi-modal “Big Data” to more precisely characterize disease at the intersection of molecular
medicine and digital health. My laboratory integrates multiple large-scale open databases with advances in digital health to
facilitate cross platform computational analyses to predict disease. I strive to translate this biological insight into clinical
innovations like novel drugs, biomarkers, and other interventions to more optimally mange disease and facilitate precision
medicine. In general, the end point of my work is rapid proofs of concept clinical trials in humans that translate into better
patient outcomes and reduced morbidity and mortality across the spectrum of disease.

C. Contribution to Science
As a new faculty member of UCF, I am building a research laboratory in close collaboration with HCA Healthcare with a
goal to translate the growing stores of clinical and research data into new drugs, diagnostics, and insights into disease.
Towards this end, I have focused my scientific inquiry thus far into three different areas:
1. Developing methods to structure and optimize the translational utility of large data stores. I have worked with
many different large-scale datasets, and I understand the importance of structuring it for better translational utility. I
developed a systems approach to functional genomics with large scale screening for biomarkers and candidate drug

repositioning using open data. I have developed the Search Tag Analyze Resource (stargeo.org) as a web application
for physicians and scientists with no bioinformatics experience to annotate digital samples and interpret disease gene
signatures using of over 1.6 million samples within NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Moving forward as a
new PI at UCSF, my laboratory will integrate multi-modal sources of both open and closed data across the gamut of
available ‘omics’ technologies to define disease pathology and to predict drugs and diagnostics for disease with an end
point of rapid proofs of concept Phase 1 and 2a clinical trials in humans.

2. Large-scale characterization of risk factors for complex disease. My background is in genomics and computational
biology, and my early work focused on design and analysis of studies to prioritize genetic risk factors for complex
disease. However, I have always had a translational focus on copy number variants (CNVs), and I contributed to
PennCNV, one of the original algorithms to call CNVs from GWAS results. As a student and a postdoc, I was exposed
to all aspects of GWAS, including assay development to detect CNVs by PCR as well as and sample recruitment for
studies in complex diseases like autism and age-related macular degeneration.

3. Translating genomic discoveries into clinical interventions for neuropsychiatric disease. I have made significant
translational discoveries across the neuropsychiatric disease spectrum working at the Center for Applied Genomics
which houses the largest academic pediatric biobank in the world with over 300,000 genotyped samples and associated
with EMRs. I was able to learn production scale genomics, and the intricacies of maintaining a large biobank. In addition
to characterizing the disease genomics of a number of disorders with both genotyping and sequencing, my work has
resulted on an ongoing ‘precision medicine’ clinical trial for ADHD (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02286817).
