Hi Bridgette,
I am writing you to request a change of PI for FDOH Contract 25C35. We are requesting that Dr. Jane Gibson https://med.ucf.edu/person/jane-s-gibson-ph-d-2/ be the new UCF PI for this project. This change would only involve a slight change in scope of
work and an updated budget – please see attached.
We would like to know any questions you all have and what is needed from us to review/approve this request and, if so, update the contract?
