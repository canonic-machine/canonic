## Axioms

### 1. Epistemic-only

PAPER is epistemic only. PAPER **MUST NOT** govern.

---

### 2. Language Identity

The CANONIC language specification is the **identity element** of the governance algebra.

```
Let L = LANGUAGE.md
Let x = any artifact

L ∘ x = x    (language governs all, adds nothing proprietary)
x ∘ L = x    (artifacts use language, remain themselves)
```

The language is **open infrastructure**—not IP. IP requires differentiation:

```
IP(x) = x + Δ    where Δ ≠ 0

LANGUAGE.md = structure + 0 = structure
∴ IP(LANGUAGE.md) = 0
```

The language is the coordinate system, not a point in the space. Protocol is open; discoveries (IDF) and applications (services) are protected.
