# SERVICES

Service-as-a-Service (SERVICEaaS) — Composable production scopes.

## Structure

```
/services/
├── writing/        — Generic production
├── products/       — Paper, Books, Grants
├── distribution/   — Publishing, Appstore
├── protection/     — Patents, Companies
└── economics/      — Token, Coin
```

## Governance

All services inherit from `/services/CANON.md`:
- Validator-bound
- Ledger-traced
- Non-governing

## Closure

APPSTORE closes the SERVICES loop — distribution endpoint for validated packages.
