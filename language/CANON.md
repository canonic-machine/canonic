# LANGUAGE (/canonic/language/)

inherits: /canonic/

## Axioms

### 1. Versioned

The language specification **MUST** be versioned using semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

---

### 2. Ledger-Frozen

Each version **MUST** be frozen to a ledger commit tag.

---

### 3. Complete

The specification **MUST** define: lexical grammar, syntactic grammar, semantic rules, and composition rules.

---

### 4. Self-Describing

The language specification **MUST** be expressible in the language it defines.

---

### 5. Validator-Enforced

Every grammar rule **MUST** have a corresponding validator.
