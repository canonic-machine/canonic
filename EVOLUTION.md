# CANONIC EVOLUTION REPORT

## Proto-CANONIC Evidence (Pre-Genesis)

Before the BIG BANG, there was proto-canonic activity documented in PAPER:

| Date | Commit | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| 2026-01-11 | `5dc73a8` | ep127 - vocab stub minimality insight |
| 2026-01-11 | `762a28e` | Triad reduced to minimal paradigm pattern |
| 2026-01-11 | `e5115d2` | ep128 - vocab-closure layer violation |
| 2026-01-11 | `edd5358` | ep129 - episode axiom layer violation |
| 2026-01-12 | `0b00a77` | ep130 - agent-model correlation analysis |

The episode numbers (ep127-130+) reveal **extensive pre-CANONIC collaboration sessions** — the intellectual foundation that preceded formalization.

**Key Proto-Insight (from v0 manuscript):**
> "We cured AI slop in 21 days by recognizing that the cure is 50 years old."
>
> "Compiler theory solved this in the 1960s. Invalid programs don't compile."

The compiler analogy was the proto-canonic seed that became CANONIC.

**MammoChat Evidence:**
- FCIF Grant 354 (Florida Cancer Innovation Fund)
- 20,000+ patient encounters
- UCF Lake Nona development
- AdventHealth partnership evidence

## The Soft BIG BANG

On **2026-01-10**, commit `d578676` initialized the LEDGER with a single message:

```
Initialize GIT machine
```

This was the **GENESIS** - the moment the canonverse began. From this singularity, all governance, all axioms, all domains, and all applications emerged through deterministic evolution.

The BIG BANG property of CANONIC means the entire system can be regenerated from its minimal fixed point:

```
MINIMAL_FIXED_POINT = LANGUAGE + VALIDATORS

BIG BANG regeneration:
1. Archive everything except LANGUAGE and VALIDATORS
2. Regenerate CANONIC/ from LANGUAGE
3. Regenerate APPSTORE/ from VALIDATORS
4. Regenerate DOMAIN/ from domain specifications
5. Restore .github/ and .transcripts/
```

**Genesis Commit:** [`d578676`](https://github.com/canonic-machine/LEDGER/commit/d578676) — LEDGER, 2026-01-10

## The Hard BIG BANG (DISTRIBUTED)

On **2026-01-23**, commit `9ec7cc9` marked the **HARD BIG BANG** — the moment CANONIC became DISTRIBUTED:

```
init: canonic-machine kernel
```

The monolithic canonverse exploded into a multi-org architecture:

        O4[canonic-apps<br/>Certified Registry]
    end

    Before --> BANG
    BANG --> O1
    BANG --> O2

    BANG --> O4

    style O1 fill:#4ecdc4
    style O2 fill:#45b7d1
    style O3 fill:#96ceb4
    style O4 fill:#ffeaa7
```

**Why Distributed?**
- **Ownership boundaries**: Each org has independent versioning
- **Governance isolation**: canonic-machine is immutable kernel
- **Domain specialization**: canonic-domains holds professional verticals
- **Instance separation**: canonic-hadley holds Hadley Lab applications
- **Certification registry**: canonic-apps tracks certified applications

## Lessons Learned

1. **Git IS the ledger** - Commit history provides temporal integrity
2. **Transcripts are deterministic** - Session records enable reconstruction
3. **REORG can lose state** - Credential files not committed were lost
4. **Monotonic inheritance works** - No downstream contradictions
5. **6 primitives suffice** - DETROS covers all compliance domains

---

## Future Evolution

The canonverse continues to evolve. This document will be updated as:
- New domains are instantiated
- New providers are credentialed
- New axioms are discovered
- New applications are certified

## The Plan: v0.3 GATE → v1.0 BIG BANG

As we walked the canonverse, the roadmap revealed itself:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Complete["COMPLETE"]
        V01[v0.1<br/>Foundation]
        V02[v0.2<br/>Validators]
        V04[v0.4<br/>ENTERPRISE]
    end

    subgraph Current["CURRENT"]
        SOFT[Soft BIG BANG<br/>2026-01-10]
        HARD[Hard BIG BANG<br/>2026-01-23]
    end

    subgraph Gate["v0.3 GATE"]
        D1[DISCLOSURE<br/>3 Provisionals]
        D2[DISTRIBUTED<br/>Multi-remote]
        D3[LANGUAGE<br/>Perfect spec]
    end

    subgraph Future["v1.0"]
        BB[TRUE BIG BANG<br/>Public CANONVERSE]
    end

    V01 --> V02 --> V04
    V04 --> SOFT --> HARD
    HARD --> D1 & D2 & D3
    D1 & D2 & D3 --> BB

    style Complete fill:#c8e6c9
    style Current fill:#fff3e0
    style Gate fill:#e3f2fd
    style Future fill:#f3e5f5
```

### v0.3 GATE Requirements

**All three must pass for v1.0:**

| Gate | Requirement | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **DISCLOSURE** | Provisionals filed (3) | Pending |
| | arXiv published | Pending |
| | Evidence vault archived | Pending |
| **DISTRIBUTED** | Multi-remote (GitHub+GitLab+Codeberg) | Pending |
| | OpenTimestamps anchoring | Pending |
| | Real immutability proven | Pending |
| **LANGUAGE** | Can regenerate CANONVERSE | Pending |
| | All axioms captured | Pending |
| | No ambiguity | Pending |

### v1.0: The TRUE BIG BANG

```
v0.x = Private development (proof, priority, preparation)
v1.0 = Public launch (claims, community, canonical)
```

The TRUE BIG BANG will:
1. Archive current ledger to evidence vault
2. Regenerate virgin CANONVERSE from LANGUAGE SPEC
3. Launch INTO distributed ledger with genesis block
4. All scopes ENTERPRISE compliant from genesis

**The CANONIC Era begins.**
