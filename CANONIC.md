# ROOT CANONIC — SPEC

inherits: /

---

## Purpose

Defines governance mechanics.

This layer establishes how rules are expressed, inherited, enforced, and invalidated.

It is domain-agnostic and content-agnostic.

---

## Scope

- Expression of governance as constraints
- Validity determination through validation
- Inheritance mechanics (explicit, monotonic)
- Authority flow (upstream binds downstream)
- Human sovereignty over governance

---

## Properties

| Property | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Explicit inheritance | No implicit authority chains |
| Monotonic inheritance | Constraints only accumulate, never weaken |
| Validation-determined | Nothing is valid until validated |
| Human sovereign | Humans may adopt, amend, or revoke |

---

## Non-Properties

This layer does NOT define:
- Domain semantics
- Specific validation rules
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Content structures

Those belong to child scopes.
