# ROADMAP (/)

**Purpose:** Track external integration milestones and strategic closure.

**Data Source:** Internal governance requirements

## 1. External Reference Survey

| External System | Integration Point | Priority |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| GitHub | APPSTORE distribution | P0 |
| Git | LEDGER storage | P0 |
| LLM | Execution layer | P0 |
| arXiv | Paper publication | P1 |
| USPTO | Patent filing | P1 |

---

## 2. External Integration Roadmap

### v0.3 (Current)

- [x] Root triad complete (CANON, VOCAB, README)
- [x] SPEC complete (CANONIC.md)
- [x] Internal closure (COVERAGE.md)
- [x] External closure (ROADMAP.md)
- [x] ENTERPRISE compliance achieved

### v0.4 (Next)

- [ ] Validators wired to GitHub Actions
- [ ] APPSTORE distribution live
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks operational

### v1.0 (Stable)

- [ ] All scopes validated automatically
- [ ] Multi-repo stack operational
- [ ] Paper v1.0 published

## 3. Competitive Analysis

| System | Governance | Inheritance | Validation | CANONIC Advantage |
|--------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| OpenAPI | Schema | No | External | Constitutional hierarchy |
| JSON Schema | Structure | $ref | External | Introspection closure |
| Terraform | State | Modules | Plan/Apply | Git-native ledger |
| Kubernetes | Declarative | No | Controllers | Human-governed axioms |

CANONIC is unique in combining governance axioms, inheritance chains, and vocabulary closure in a Git-native system.

## 4. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Validator complexity | High | Atomic validators, formal predicates |
| Adoption friction | Medium | Templates, onboarding docs |
| Scope creep | Medium | Frozen root axioms |
| Multi-repo coordination | Medium | Stack composition rules |

---

## 5. Success Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Root ENTERPRISE compliance | v0.3 | ✓ Complete |
| GitHub Action validators | v0.4 | Planned |
| Paper publication | v1.0 | Planned |
| 10+ governed scopes | v1.0 | In progress |

---

## 6. Conclusion

CANONIC root external closure is **on track**.

Current version (v0.3) achieves ENTERPRISE compliance. Next milestones focus on validator distribution and paper publication.
