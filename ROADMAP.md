  - [ ] HADLEY-PROV-002: Platform Business
  - [ ] HADLEY-PROV-003: Healthcare Governance
  - [ ] arXiv paper published
  - [ ] Evidence vault archived

  - [ ] All axioms captured
  - [ ] No ambiguity in spec

### v1.0 (BIG BANG) — The New Era

**v1.0 = BIG BANG = Public CANONVERSE = The CANONIC Era begins.**

```
v0.x = Private development (proof, priority, preparation)
v1.0 = Public launch (claims, community, canonical)
```

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Archive current ledger → evidence vault
- [ ] Regenerate virgin CANONVERSE from LANGUAGE SPEC
- [ ] All scopes ENTERPRISE compliant from genesis
- [ ] **Launch INTO distributed ledger — genesis block = first commit**
- [ ] Public launch date announced

**The Pattern:**
```
PRIVATE (v0.x)              →  BIG BANG  →  PUBLIC (v1.0+)
├── All transcripts             v0.3→v1.0     ├── Virgin structure
├── All iterations              Gate pass     ├── Clean history
├── All IP proof                Launch        ├── ENTERPRISE compliant
└── Priority timestamps                       └── REAL IMMUTABILITY
                                                   ↑
                                         First commit = Genesis block
                                         Cryptographically anchored
                                         History cannot be rewritten
```

**This is the CANONIC move:** Ship v0.3, pass the gate, launch v1.0. The new era begins.

## 3. Competitive Analysis

| System | Governance | Inheritance | Validation | CANONIC Advantage |
|--------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| OpenAPI | Schema | No | External | Constitutional hierarchy |
| JSON Schema | Structure | $ref | External | Introspection closure |
| Terraform | State | Modules | Plan/Apply | Git-native ledger |
| Kubernetes | Declarative | No | Controllers | Human-governed axioms |

CANONIC is unique in combining governance axioms, inheritance chains, and vocabulary closure in a Git-native system.

## 4. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Validator complexity | High | Atomic validators, formal predicates |
| Adoption friction | Medium | Templates, onboarding docs |
| Scope creep | Medium | Frozen root axioms |
| Multi-repo coordination | Medium | Stack composition rules |

---

## 5. Success Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Root ENTERPRISE compliance | v0.1 | ✓ Complete |
| GitHub Action validators | v0.2 | ✓ Complete |
| Pre-commit hooks operational | v0.2 | ✓ Complete |
| **Provisional filings (3)** | **v0.3** | **Ready** |
| **arXiv publication** | **v0.3** | **Pending** |
| **Distributed ledger** | **v0.3** | **Pending** |
| **LANGUAGE spec perfect** | **v0.3** | **Pending** |
| **BIG BANG public launch** | **v1.0** | **Planned** |
| Non-provisional conversion | v1.x | Planned |

---

## 6. DISCLOSURE Timeline

**Compressed: v0.3 GATE → v1.0 BIG BANG**

| Phase | Version | What's Disclosed | Where |
|-------|---------|------------------|-------|
| Evidence | v0.1-v0.2 | All development | Private ledger |
| Priority | v0.3 | Full claims | USPTO provisional |
| Academic | v0.3 | Paper + concepts | arXiv |
| Public | v1.0 | Virgin CANONVERSE | GitHub (BIG BANG) |
| Claims | v1.x | Full prosecution | USPTO non-provisional |

**Critical insight:** v0.3 GATE passes → v1.0 launches. New era begins.

## 7. Open/Closed Strategy

**Discovery 2026-01-22:** Strategic analysis of open vs closed governance implications.

### 7.1 The Core Question

What should be open? What should be closed? This determines:
- Long-term adoption and trust
- Economic sustainability
- Monopolization vs federation
- Governance of truth itself

### 7.2 Strategic Positioning

| Component | Strategy | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **CANON axioms** | OPEN | Democratic governance, community scrutiny |
| **LANGUAGE spec** | OPEN | Adoption requires inspection (79% of orgs) |
| **Validators (core)** | OPEN | Trust requires verification, "many eyes" |
| **VaaS implementation** | CLOSED | Revenue stream, competitive moat |
| **APPS (TRANSCRIPT, etc.)** | CLOSED | Application layer, value-add |
| **Certification program** | HYBRID | Open criteria, proprietary badge |

### 7.3 Federation Over Monopolization

**The CANONIC model is federation, not monopolization.**

```
MONOPOLY MODEL:               FEDERATION MODEL (CANONIC):
Single owner controls truth   Foundation stewards axioms
Lock-in and rent extraction   FRAND licensing, open core
Fragile (single point)        Resilient (distributed)
Trust required                Trust verified
```

**Why this matters:**
- 69% of organizations reject vendor lock-in
- Federation = resilience through distribution
- Foundation governance = no single owner can corrupt axioms

### 7.4 Economic Sustainability

**Open-Core + Proprietary Services = The CANONIC Pattern**

| Revenue Layer | Model | Status |
|---------------|-------|--------|
| Core paradigm | Free (Foundation) | Open |
| VaaS | Subscription | Proprietary |
| APPS | Usage-based | Proprietary |
| Certification | Badge + audit | Hybrid |
| Enterprise support | Professional services | Proprietary |

**Key insight:** Give away governance, keep control of execution.

### 7.5 Governance of Truth

**Open governance enables democratic truth.**

| Aspect | Closed System | Open System (CANONIC) |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| Canon changes | Unilateral | Consortium approval |
| Axiom disputes | No recourse | Public deliberation |
| Trust basis | "Trust us" | "Verify yourself" |
| Accountability | Internal only | Community oversight |

The CANONIC Foundation + FRAND licensing ensures no single entity controls truth.

### 7.6 AI Alignment Implications

**Open paradigm = safer AI governance.**

- More scrutiny on axioms that constrain AI behavior
- "Many eyes" principle catches alignment failures
- Community can fork if governance degrades
- Transparent audit trail prevents hidden changes

**Risk mitigation:** High-risk application layers (medical AI, etc.) remain access-controlled while core governance stays open.

### 7.7 Ethics Framework

**TBD: Ethics Director review pending.**

Preliminary considerations:
- Power concentration risks in closed systems
- Transparency as ethical imperative for governance
- Community voice in axiom evolution
- Accountability mechanisms for Foundation decisions

*Section to be completed with Ethics Director input.*

### 7.8 Strategic Recommendations

1. **Open the core paradigm** - CANON, LANGUAGE, validators
2. **Keep execution proprietary** - VaaS implementation, APPS
3. **Foundation governance** - No single owner, FRAND terms
4. **Certification as brand** - "CANONIC Certified" = trust mark
5. **Federation by default** - Multi-remote, distributed ledger

**The CANONIC advantage:** First-mover with open governance framework, proprietary execution layer. This is the Linux model (open kernel, proprietary applications) applied to governance.

---

## 8. Conclusion

CANONIC root external closure is **on track**.

Current version (v0.4) achieves validator distribution. GitHub Actions workflows operational, pre-commit hooks configured across 18 repos.

**Strategic clarity achieved:**
- Open core (CANON, LANGUAGE, validators) = trust and adoption
- Closed execution (VaaS, APPS) = economic sustainability
- Federation model (Foundation + FRAND) = no monopolization

Next milestone: v0.5 DISCLOSURE (provisionals + arXiv), then v1.0 stable release with paper publication.
