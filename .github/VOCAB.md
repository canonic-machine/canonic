## Axioms

### GitHub IS the App Store

The foundational principle: GitHub provides everything CANONIC needs.
User management, billing, discovery, CI/CD, certification - all from GitHub.

### Zero Infrastructure

APPSTORE MUST NOT require custom infrastructure.
GitHub builds everything; we build validators only.

### Validator Distribution

Validators MUST be distributed via GitHub Actions.
CANONIC validators are reusable Actions (canonic/vaas-*).
