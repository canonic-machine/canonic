# CANONIC (/)

The constitutional foundation of the CANONIC paradigm.

---

## Purpose

Define the minimal structural and semantic laws that govern all downstream scopes.

CANONIC establishes the root governance layer from which all other scopes inherit.

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- Triad definition (CANON, VOCAB, README)
- Inheritance chain termination
- Introspection requirement
- Compliance tier definitions

### Out of Scope

- Enforcement mechanics (see MACHINE)
- Execution semantics (see OS)
- Ledger operations (see LEDGER)
- Validator implementation (see VALIDATORS)

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# Validate a scope
python validators/vaas.py /path/to/scope

# Check triad exists
ls CANON.md VOCAB.md README.md

# Check inheritance
grep "inherits:" CANON.md
```
