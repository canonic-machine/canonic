# CANONIC

This repository hosts the minimal triad and the CANONIC spec.

- `CANON.md` defines the root constitution.
- `VOCAB.md` defines the terms used by CANON and SPEC.
- `README.md` (this file) describes the repository purpose.
- `CANONIC.md` is the instantiated SPEC for the paradigm.
- Machine hosts the generic templates for CANON, VOCAB, README, and SPEC.

Violations are handled downstream.
