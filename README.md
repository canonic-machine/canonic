# CANONIC

This repository hosts the minimal triad, the CANONIC spec, and the generic templates.

- `CANON.md` defines the root constitution.
- `VOCAB.md` defines the terms used by CANON and SPEC.
- `README.md` (this file) describes the repository purpose.
- `CANONIC.md` is the instantiated SPEC for the paradigm.
- `templates/` contains CANON, VOCAB, README, and SPEC templates.

Violations are handled downstream.
