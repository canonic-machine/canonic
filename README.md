# CANONIC

The constitutional governance paradigm defining the minimal structural and semantic rules all scopes must satisfy.

---

## Governance Path

`/`

Inherits from: `/` (self-terminating root)

---

## Purpose

CANONIC establishes the foundational governance framework for all CANONIC scopes. It defines the three constitutional axioms (Triad, Inheritance, Introspection) that every valid scope must satisfy.

---

## Scope

### In scope

- Definition of the triad requirement (CANON.md, VOCAB.md, README.md)
- Declaration of inheritance rules terminating at root
- Introspection axiom requiring VOCAB to define all content concepts
- Constitutional validity for all governed scopes

### Out of scope

- Enforcement mechanics (delegated to MACHINE)
- Operational constraints (delegated to OS)
- Persistence semantics (delegated to LEDGER)
- Template structures (delegated to TEMPLATES)
