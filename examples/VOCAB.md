## Example-Specific Terms

### hello-world example
Simplest possible CANONIC system demonstrating single-file constraint validation. One file, one constraint, minimal validator.

### pedagogical progression
Examples ordered by increasing complexity to teach concepts incrementally. Each example builds on previous understanding.

### simple-fsm example
State machine example demonstrating validation gates at transitions, backflow on failure, and git-FSM pattern. Three states: draft → review → published.

### canonic-readme example
Document governance example demonstrating nested triad structure, inheritance chains, and rich constraint specifications.
