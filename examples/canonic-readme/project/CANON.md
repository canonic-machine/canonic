# CANON (canonic-programming/examples/canonic-readme/project/)

**Inherits from:** ../CANON.md

## Project-specific constraints

**Inherits document governance from parent (engagement, accuracy, references).**

**Python code requirements:**
- All Python code must pass type checking (mypy)
- Functions must have docstrings
- Example code must run without errors

**Documentation structure:**
- README must explain what the code does
- README must show how to run the code
- README must demonstrate the inheritance concept

**Violation:** Code fails type checking, missing docstrings, or README incomplete
