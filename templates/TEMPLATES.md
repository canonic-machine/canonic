# TEMPLATES

1. Purpose
   - Define the template scope for CANONIC.

2. Scope
   - Applies to /canonic/templates/.
   - Inherits from /.

3. Constraints
   - Templates are placeholders for CANONIC governance artifacts.
   - Templates are flat in this folder (no subfolders).

4. Validation
   - Templates exist for CANON, SPEC, VOCAB, and README.
   - Templates remain placeholder-only.

5. Consumption notes
   - Downstream scopes instantiate templates for local scope.
