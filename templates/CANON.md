# TEMPLATES (/canonic/templates/)

inherits: /

## Axioms

### 1. Structural role

Templates exist solely as placeholder structures for CANONIC governance artifacts.

Templates define file shape and presence only.

---

### 2. Non-authority

Templates **MUST NOT** introduce governance, enforcement, execution semantics, or interpretation.

Templates have no legal, authoritative, or executable effect.

---

**This CANON defines validity for the TEMPLATES scope.**
