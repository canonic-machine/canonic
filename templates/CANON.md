# TEMPLATES (/canonic/templates/)

inherits: /

## Axioms

### 1. Structural role

Templates exist solely as placeholder structures for CANONIC governance artifacts.

Templates define file shape and presence only.

---

### 2. Non-authority

Templates **MUST NOT** introduce governance, enforcement, execution semantics, or interpretation.

Templates have no legal, authoritative, or executable effect.

---

### 3. Documentation canonification

Templates canonify documentation patterns.

When a documentation structure is added to a template, that pattern becomes the canonical form for all instances of that artifact type.

---

### 4. Template completeness

CANON templates **SHOULD** include:

- Axioms section (normative)
- Lifecycle section (origin, current state, automation drift)
- Best Practices section (non-normative, **SHOULD**-level guidance)
- References section (cross-references to episodes and related scopes)

---

### 5. Template naming

Template stubs **MUST** be named `TEMPLATE-###-stub.md`, where `###` is a
three-digit template index. The template prefix **MUST** be uppercase.

---

## Lifecycle

**Origin:** Templates scope created to canonify documentation patterns and provide structural bootstrapping for new scopes.

**Current state:** AI-assisted. Human defines template structure; AI assists with template instantiation and pattern propagation across scopes.

**Automation drift:** Template creation remains human-governed. Template instantiation and structural validation are fully automatable. Pattern evolution requires human deliberation to maintain non-authority constraint.
