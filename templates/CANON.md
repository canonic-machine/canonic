# TEMPLATES (/canonic/templates/)

inherits: /

## Axioms

### 1. Structural role

Templates exist solely as placeholder structures for CANONIC governance artifacts.

Templates define file shape and presence only.

---

### 2. Non-authority

Templates **MUST NOT** introduce governance, enforcement, execution semantics, or interpretation.

Templates have no legal, authoritative, or executable effect.

---

### 3. Documentation canonification

Templates canonify documentation patterns.

When a documentation structure is added to a template, that pattern becomes the canonical form for all instances of that artifact type.

---

### 4. Template completeness

CANON templates **SHOULD** include:

- Axioms section (normative)
- Lifecycle section (origin, current state, automation drift)
- Best Practices section (non-normative, SHOULD-level guidance)
- References section (cross-references to episodes, IDFs, related scopes)

---

**This CANON defines validity for the TEMPLATES scope.**
