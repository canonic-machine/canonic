# TEMPLATES

Placeholder scaffolds for CANONIC governance artifacts, defining file shape and presence without governance authority.

---

## Governance Path

`/canonic/templates/`

Inherits from: `/`

---

## Purpose

TEMPLATES provides structural bootstrapping for new scopes. Templates canonify documentation patterns, establishing the canonical form for governance artifacts. Templates define shape and presence only; they introduce no governance, enforcement, or interpretation.

---

## Scope

### In scope

- Placeholder scaffolds for CANON, VOCAB, README, and SPEC artifacts
- Structural role definition (file shape and presence)
- Documentation canonification patterns
- Template completeness guidelines (axioms, lifecycle, best practices, references)

### Out of scope

- Governance, enforcement, or execution semantics
- Legal, authoritative, or executable effect
- Content meaning or interpretation
- Runtime behavior
