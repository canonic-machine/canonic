## Content Concepts

### template

A placeholder scaffold for a governance artifact; defines file shape and presence only.

---

### te-000-spec-template.md

The template for a SPEC (TE-000).

---

### te-001-canon-template.md

The template for a CANON (TE-001).

---

### te-002-vocab-template.md

The template for a VOCAB (TE-002).

---

### te-003-readme-template.md

The template for a README (TE-003).

---

### placeholder

A scaffold that defines structure without governance content.

---

### structural role

The property that templates exist solely as placeholder structures.

---

### non-authority

The property that templates introduce no governance, enforcement, execution semantics, or interpretation.

---

### documentation canonification

The process by which adding a documentation structure to a template makes that pattern the canonical form for all instances of that artifact type.

---

### template completeness

The property of a CANON template that includes axioms, lifecycle, best practices, and references sections.

---

### lifecycle section

A template section documenting origin, current state, and automation drift for a machine scope.

---

### best practices section

A template section for non-normative SHOULD-level operational guidance.

---

### references section

A template section for cross-references to related episodes, IDFs, and scopes.

---

### structural bootstrapping

The purpose of templates to bootstrap CANONIC scopes with correct file structure; templates define shape and presence, not meaning.

---

### closure precedence

The ordering of template elements by authority: SPEC (closes scope) → CANON (governance) → VOCAB (semantics) → README (description). TE-000 through TE-003 reflect this ordering.
