## Content Concepts

### template

A placeholder scaffold for a governance artifact; defines file shape and presence only.

---

### te-0.0-closure-template.md

The template for a closure (TE-0.0); scope closes itself.

---

### te-0.1-canon-template.md

The template for a CANON (TE-0.1); governance.

---

### te-0.2-vocab-template.md

The template for a VOCAB (TE-0.2); semantics.

---

### te-0.3-readme-template.md

The template for a README (TE-0.3); description.

---

### te-0.4-roadmap-template.md

The template for a ROADMAP (TE-0.4); implementation phases, milestones, dependencies.

---

### placeholder

A scaffold that defines structure without governance content.

---

### structural role

The property that templates exist solely as placeholder structures.

---

### non-authority

The property that templates introduce no governance, enforcement, execution semantics, or interpretation.

---

### documentation canonification

The process by which adding a documentation structure to a template makes that pattern the canonical form for all instances of that artifact type.

---

### template completeness

The property of a CANON template that includes axioms, lifecycle, best practices, and references sections.

---

### lifecycle section

A template section documenting origin, current state, and automation drift for a machine scope.

---

### best practices section

A template section for non-normative SHOULD-level operational guidance.

---

### references section

A template section for cross-references to related episodes, IDFs, and scopes.

---

### structural bootstrapping

The purpose of templates to bootstrap CANONIC scopes with correct file structure; templates define shape and presence, not meaning.

---

### closure precedence

The ordering of template elements by authority: Closure → CANON → VOCAB → README → ROADMAP. TE-0.0 through TE-0.4 reflect this ordering.
