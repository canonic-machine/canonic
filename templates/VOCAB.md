## Content Concepts

### template

A placeholder scaffold for a governance artifact; defines file shape and presence only.

---

### template stub

A placeholder template file used to instantiate a governance artifact.

---

### template index

The three-digit number in a template stub filename.

---

### template prefix

The leading `TEMPLATE` token in a template stub filename.

---

### template naming

The naming convention for template stubs, including prefix, index, and suffix.

---

### TEMPLATE-000-stub.md

The template for a SPEC; scope closes itself.

---

### TEMPLATE-001-stub.md

The template for a CANON; governance.

---

### TEMPLATE-002-stub.md

The template for a VOCAB; semantics.

---

### TEMPLATE-003-stub.md

The template for a README; description.

---

### TEMPLATE-004-stub.md

The template for a COVERAGE; external closure mapping.

---

### TEMPLATE-005-stub.md

The template for a ROADMAP; implementation phases, milestones, dependencies.

---

### placeholder

A scaffold that defines structure without governance content.

---

### structural role

The property that templates exist solely as placeholder structures.

---

### non-authority

The property that templates introduce no governance, enforcement, execution semantics, or interpretation.

---

### documentation canonification

The process by which adding a documentation structure to a template makes that pattern the canonical form for all instances of that artifact type.

---

### template completeness

The property of a CANON template that includes axioms, lifecycle, best practices, and references sections.

---

### lifecycle section

A template section documenting origin, current state, and automation drift for a machine scope.

---

### best practices section

A template section for non-normative SHOULD-level operational guidance.

---

### references section

A template section for cross-references to related episodes and scopes.

---

### structural bootstrapping

The purpose of templates to bootstrap CANONIC scopes with correct file structure; templates define shape and presence, not meaning.

---

### closure precedence

The ordering of template elements by authority: SPEC → CANON → VOCAB → README → ROADMAP. TEMPLATE-000 through TEMPLATE-005 reflect this ordering.
