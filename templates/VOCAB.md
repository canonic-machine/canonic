# VOCAB (/canonic/templates/)

## Core concepts

### TEMPLATES
The templates scope.

### templates
The collection of template files in this scope.

### template
A placeholder scaffold for a governance artifact.

### CANON
The axioms for a scope.

### SPEC
The human specification for a scope.

### VOCAB
The concepts for a scope; it defines the concepts used by CANON and itself.

### README
The README for a scope.

### CANON.md
The CANON file for a scope.

### te003-spec-template.md
The template for a SPEC.

### te002-vocab-template.md
The template for a VOCAB.

### te004-readme-template.md
The template for a README.

### te001-canon-template.md
The template for a CANON.

### scope
The area governed by a CANON and its triad.

### triad
The required governance artifacts for a scope: CANON.md, VOCAB.md, README.md.

### axioms
The CANON statements for a scope.

### inheritance
The declared linkage from a scope to its parent scope.

### inherits
The declared parent scope for a CANON.

### declares
To state an inheritance linkage in CANON.

### contains
To hold governance artifacts within a scope.

### inherited
Axioms taken from a parent scope.

### final
The property that inherited axioms cannot be overridden.

### cannot
A statement of prohibition.

### overridden
A final axiom that is replaced in a downstream scope.

### introspection
The requirement that VOCAB defines concepts used by CANON and itself.

### defines
To state meanings in VOCAB.

### concept
A governed meaning unit named by a VOCAB heading and referenced by CANON.

### used
Employed in CANON statements.

### every
Without exception.

### itself
The same artifact referring to itself.

### placeholder
A scaffold that defines structure without governance content.

### structures
Organizational patterns defined by templates.

### shape
The structural form of a governance artifact.

### presence
The requirement that a file exists within a scope.

### governance
The normative rules that define validity for a scope.

### enforcement
The mechanisms that ensure governance compliance.

### execution semantics
The operational behavior of artifacts at runtime.

### interpretation
The process of deriving meaning from artifacts.

### documentation canonification
The process by which adding a documentation structure to a template makes that pattern the canonical form for all instances of that artifact type.

### template completeness
The property of a CANON template that includes axioms, lifecycle, best practices, and references sections.

### lifecycle section
A template section documenting origin, current state, and automation drift for a machine scope.

### best practices section
A template section for non-normative SHOULD-level operational guidance.

### references section
A template section for cross-references to related episodes, IDFs, and scopes.

### IDF
Invention Disclosure Form; a documented invention disclosure that captures a novel idea, method, or system for potential patent protection.

### IDFs
The collection of Invention Disclosure Forms; tracked by layer (Foundation, Operational, Patent Machine, Domain Apps, Emergent).

### episodes
Documented sessions or conversations that produce artifacts, decisions, or governance changes.

### master plan
The SPEC artifact; defines the roadmap and future vision for a scope while README captures current state.

### current state snapshot
The README artifact's role; describes what exists now, distinct from SPEC's roadmap.

### roadmap
A SPEC section documenting milestones and evolution trajectory toward the perfect paradigm.

### generation metadata
A SPEC section recording creation date, last update, generator (human/AI/episode), and template version.

### artifact relationships
A SPEC section with mermaid diagram showing how CANON, VOCAB, README, and SPEC relate within a scope.

### future vision
A SPEC section describing the target state the scope is evolving toward through canonification.

End of VOCAB.
