# GOVERNANCE LANGUAGE — CANON

inherits: /CANONIC/

---

- Governance dimensions are fixed and complete.
- The dimensions are:
  - Declarative
  - Evidential
  - Temporal
  - Relational
  - Operational
  - Structural
- No additional governance dimensions are permitted.
- An artifact failing a required dimension is invalid.
- The cybernetic loop governs all production:
  - Signal (domain declares intent)
  - Operation (process transforms)
  - Artifact (outputs produced)
  - Feedback (ledger validates signal)
- Feedback after artifacts is the killer feature.
