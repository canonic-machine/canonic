## Content Concepts

### artifact

A file governed by CANON.

---

### axiom

A normative rule declared in CANON.

---

### CANON

The governance artifact of a scope.

---

### CANONIC

The constitutional governance paradigm defined by the root scope; establishes the minimal structural and semantic rules all scopes must satisfy.

---

### CANONIC.md

The paradigm specification artifact; defines the CANONIC paradigm in prose form.

---

### canonbase

The full inheritance graph of all scopes governed by CANONIC, spanning all repositories in a workspace.

---

### content concept

A term defined in VOCAB and used in CANON or VOCAB.

---

### inheritance

The relationship by which a scope adopts axioms from a parent scope.

---

### README

The descriptive artifact of a scope.

---

### LICENSE

The repository license file named `LICENSE`.

---

### NOTICE

The repository attribution file named `NOTICE`.

---

### root scope

The scope at `/` from which all other scopes inherit; the termination point of inheritance.

---

### repository

A versioned source-control project with a single top-level directory.

---

### repository root scope

A scope that is the top-level directory of a repository.

---

### scope

A directory governed by a triad.

---

### triad

The set of artifacts (`CANON.md`, `VOCAB.md`, `README.md`) required for a valid scope.

---

### validity

The state of a scope that satisfies all applicable axioms.

---

### SPEC

A specification artifact that defines requirements for a scope.

---

### VOCAB

The vocabulary artifact of a scope.

---

### lifecycle

The documented evolution of a scope from origin through current state to projected automation trajectory.

---

### automation drift

The trajectory of a scope from human-driven operation toward AI-automated execution. Documents the progressive shift of execution responsibility while preserving human authority over governance.

---

### machine scope

A scope that defines execution semantics for a CANONIC system. Machine scopes document their lifecycle and automation drift.

---

### canonification

The process of evolving artifacts toward canonical form through iterative refinement; each cycle brings structure closer to the perfect paradigm defined by templates.

---

### perfect paradigm

The ideal structural form defined by CANONIC templates; the target state toward which all governed artifacts evolve through canonification.

---

### IDF

Invention Disclosure Form; a documented invention disclosure that captures a novel idea, method, or system for potential patent protection.

---

### IDFs

The collection of Invention Disclosure Forms; tracked by layer (Foundation, Operational, Patent Machine, Domain Apps, Emergent).

---

### episode

A documented session or conversation that produces artifacts, decisions, or governance changes.

---

### episodes

The collection of documented sessions across all scopes; the primary production output of the CANONIC paradigm.

---

### governance

The authority structure and rules defined by CANON that constrain scope behavior; governance defines what is valid, not how validity is enforced or executed.

---

### layer discipline

The axiom requiring concepts to be defined in the scope that introduces them; axioms belong where they govern, and concepts flow downstream only through inheritance.

---

### VOCAB closure

The property allowing root VOCAB definitions to be circular and minimal; root concepts are self-grounding with meaning emerging from structure and canonical context.

---

### introspection

The axiom requiring VOCAB to define every content concept used by CANON and VOCAB itself; ensures semantic completeness within each scope. (IDF-006)

---

### root minimalism

The axiom requiring root CANON to contain only paradigm-level axioms; implementation, procedures, and narratives belong in downstream scopes.

---

## IDF Closure

The following concepts are documented by Invention Disclosure Forms in the PATENTS scope:

| Concept | IDF | Title |
|---------|-----|-------|
| CANONIC governance | IDF-001 | Constitutional Governance Paradigm |
| introspection | IDF-006 | Literal Introspection |
| canonification | IDF-071 | Canonic Composition |
| perfect paradigm | IDF-071 | Canonic Composition |
| layer discipline | IDF-095 | Structural Bootstrapping |
| VOCAB closure | IDF-087 | Mathematical Closure Geometry |
| lifecycle | IDF-040 | AI Auto-Discovery IDF Protocol |
| automation drift | IDF-040 | AI Auto-Discovery IDF Protocol |
| series artifact nomenclature | IDF-091 | Portfolio Coverage Standardization |
| prefix canonicity | IDF-093 | Prefix Canonicity Constraint |
| directory discriminant | IDF-094 | Directory Discriminant Pattern |
| structural bootstrapping | IDF-095 | Structural Bootstrapping Pattern |

This table closes the canonbase to the patent portfolio, establishing traceability from root concepts to inventive disclosures.
