## Content Concepts

### artifact

A file governed by CANON.

---

### axiom

A normative rule declared in CANON.

---

### CANON

The governance artifact of a scope.

---

### CANONIC

The axioms of compliant governance defined by the root scope; may be imperfect; establishes minimal structural and semantic rules.

---

### content concept

A term defined in VOCAB and used in CANON or VOCAB.

---

### inheritance

The relationship by which a scope adopts axioms from a parent scope.

---

### README

The descriptive artifact of a scope.

---

### SPEC

The specification artifact that closes a scope. In CANONIC, `CANONIC.md` is the SPEC that closes the root scope.

---

### root scope

The scope at `/` from which all other scopes inherit; the termination point of inheritance.

---

### scope

A directory governed by a triad. With a SPEC, the scope is closed.

---

### triad

The set of artifacts (`CANON.md`, `VOCAB.md`, `README.md`) required for a valid scope.

---

### validity

The state of a scope that satisfies all applicable axioms.

---

### VOCAB

The vocabulary artifact of a scope.

---

### proto-scope

A directory that satisfies triad but lacks SPEC (open).

---

### introspection

The axiom requiring VOCAB to define every content concept used by CANON and VOCAB itself.
