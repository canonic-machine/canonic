## Content Concepts

### artifact

A file governed by CANON.

---

### axiom

A normative rule declared in CANON.

---

### CANON

The governance artifact of a scope.

---

### CANONIC

The constitutional governance paradigm defined by the root scope; establishes the minimal structural and semantic rules all scopes must satisfy.

---

### CANONIC.md

The paradigm specification artifact; defines the CANONIC paradigm in prose form.

---

### canonbase

The full inheritance graph of all scopes governed by CANONIC, spanning all repositories in a workspace.

---

### content concept

A term defined in VOCAB and used in CANON or VOCAB.

---

### inheritance

The relationship by which a scope adopts axioms from a parent scope.

---

### README

The descriptive artifact of a scope.

---

### LICENSE

The repository license file named `LICENSE`.

---

### NOTICE

The repository attribution file named `NOTICE`.

---

### root scope

The scope at `/` from which all other scopes inherit; the termination point of inheritance.

---

### repository

A versioned source-control project with a single top-level directory.

---

### repository root scope

A scope that is the top-level directory of a repository.

---

### scope

A directory governed by a triad.

---

### triad

The set of artifacts (`CANON.md`, `VOCAB.md`, `README.md`) required for a valid scope.

---

### validity

The state of a scope that satisfies all applicable axioms.

---

### SPEC

A specification artifact that defines requirements for a scope.

---

### VOCAB

The vocabulary artifact of a scope.

---

### lifecycle

The documented evolution of a machine scope from origin through current state to projected automation trajectory.

---

### automation drift

The trajectory of a machine scope from human-driven operation toward AI-automated execution. Documents the progressive shift of execution responsibility while preserving human authority over governance.

---

### machine scope

A scope that defines execution semantics for a CANONIC system. Machine scopes document their lifecycle and automation drift.

---

### canonification

The process of evolving artifacts toward canonical form through iterative refinement; each cycle brings structure closer to the perfect paradigm defined by templates.

---

### perfect paradigm

The ideal structural form defined by CANONIC templates; the target state toward which all governed artifacts evolve through canonification.

---

### IDF

Invention Disclosure Form; a documented invention disclosure that captures a novel idea, method, or system for potential patent protection.

---

### IDFs

The collection of Invention Disclosure Forms; tracked by layer (Foundation, Operational, Patent Machine, Domain Apps, Emergent).

---

### episode

A documented session or conversation that produces artifacts, decisions, or governance changes.

---

### episodes

The collection of documented sessions across all scopes; the primary production output of the CANONIC paradigm.
