## Core terms

### CANONIC
The constitutional programming paradigm defined by the root scope.

### CANON

### VOCAB
The meanings artifact for a scope; it defines the terms used by CANON and defines itself.

### README
The narrative artifact that explains a scope to humans.

### SPEC
A declarative artifact that defines patterns or constraints not captured by CANON.

### template
A reusable blueprint for instantiating a governance artifact.

### machine
The validation engine layer that performs mechanical checks and correction downstream of CANONIC.

### triad
The required set of governance artifacts in every scope: CANON.md, VOCAB.md, README.md.

### scope
The area governed by a CANON and its triad.

### inheritance
The declared linkage from a scope to the scope it inherits from.

### coherence
The property that CANON statements do not contradict.

### compliance
The property that structural requirements (triad + inheritance declaration) are satisfied.

### governance
The state where coherence and compliance both hold.

### governed
A scope that is both coherent and compliant.

### invalidity
The state of not being governed.

### introspection
The requirement that VOCAB defines itself and the CANON it supports.

End of VOCAB.
