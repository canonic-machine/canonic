# CANONIC (/)

inherits: /

## Axioms

### 1. Triad

A scope **MUST** contain the following artifacts:

- `CANON.md`
- `VOCAB.md`
- `README.md`

Absence of any triad artifact renders the scope invalid.

---

### 2. Inheritance

Every `CANON.md` **MUST** declare the scope it inherits from.

- Inheritance **MUST** terminate at `/`.
- Inherited axioms are final and **MUST NOT** be overridden.

---

### 3. Introspection

`VOCAB.md` **MUST** define every content concept used by:

- this CANON, and
- `VOCAB.md` itself.

Undefined content concepts render the scope invalid.

## Lifecycle

**Origin:** Constitutional governance paradigm discovered through iterative refinement of AI-assisted documentation workflows. Formalized as IDF-001 (Constitutional Governance Paradigm).

**Current state:** AI-assisted. Human authority defines axioms; AI assists with validation, introspection checking, and canonification.

**Automation drift:** Axiom definition remains human-governed. Validation and introspection checking are automatable via VaaS. Governance evolution requires human deliberation; automation bounded by constitutional structure.
