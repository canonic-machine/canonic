CANONIC (/)

inherits: /

axioms:

1. triad:
   a governed scope contains CANON.md, VOCAB.md, README.md

2. inheritance:
   every CANON.md declares the scope it inherits from
   inheritance terminates at /

3. coherence:
   a scope is coherent iff its CANON statements do not contradict

4. compliance:
   a scope is compliant iff the triad exists and inheritance is declared

5. governance:
   a scope is governed iff it is coherent and compliant

6. invalidity:
   any scope not governed is invalid

7. introspection:
   VOCAB defines the terms used by this CANON and itself
