# CANONIC (/)

inherits: /

## Axioms

### 1. Triad

A scope **MUST** contain the following artifacts:

- `CANON.md`
- `VOCAB.md`
- `README.md`

Absence of any triad artifact renders the scope invalid.

---

### 2. Inheritance

Every `CANON.md` **MUST** declare the scope it inherits from.

- Inheritance **MUST** terminate at `/`.
- Inherited axioms are final and **MUST NOT** be overridden.

---

### 3. Introspection

`VOCAB.md` **MUST** define every content concept used by:

- this CANON, and
- `VOCAB.md` itself.

Undefined content concepts render the scope invalid.

---

**This CANON defines constitutional validity for all CANONIC scopes.**
